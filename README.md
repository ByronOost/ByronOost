### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Byron Oosthuizen 
I studied at Varisty College Sandton from 2019 - 2021 
I achieved a Bachelors Degree in Computer Sciences and Application Develpoment 
This is a new GitHub account and I will regularly update it with projects I have worked on 

Please take a look at my code that I have worked on in the past not all my code is available as some of it is too big as their are too many files for GitHub 
feel free to contact me at email address Byrono52@hotmail.co.uk for more information about what I have worked on
